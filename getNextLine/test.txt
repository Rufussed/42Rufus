Hello, world! This is a test of the get_next_line function.
Each new line reads until the newline character is found.
Testing how it handles empty lines in between.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

After this line, there should be two newline characters.


This line checks if it can read lines with multiple newlines following it.



End of file should be handled gracefully without any issues.
What happens when the text abruptly ends without a newline?
