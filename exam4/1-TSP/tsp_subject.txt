Question 1 - TSP
 Write a program that will read a set of city coordinates under the form '%f, %f\n' from the stdint and will print the length of the shortest possible path containing all these cities under the form %.2f
 
 Your program should work like this:
 
 cat square.txt
 0.0, 0.0
 0.0, 1.0
 1.0, 0.0
 1.0, 1.0
 
 $> ./tsp < square.txt | cat -e
 4.00$
 
 We will not test your program with more than 11 cities.
 
 Authorized functions: getline, sqrtf, stdin, stdout, fprintf, write fscanf

 The function to calculate the distances between coordinates (not the original one provided, reconstructed at home):
 
 double  distance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
 {
     return sqrtf((x2 - x1) * (x2 - x1) + (y2 - y1) * (y2 - y1));
 }
