Powerset - writing a program that takes multiple argument. First one is the sum.
All the others are members. Print all the sets of members where the total of the
set is the sum. 

Eg
./a.out 4 1 3
1 3
./a.out 4 1 5 -1 3
1 3
5 -1

allowed functions: atoi, printf, malloc, calloc, realloc, free

args:	n[s]
	[s] - set of numbers
	[n] - integer value

task: 
display subsets of [s] whose sum is equal to n. No duplicates

malloc error - exit with code 1
if there is no set satisfying the task print new line
empty set is also sub-set!
set like in python
positive 1 negative (??)

We will not test with invalid set
